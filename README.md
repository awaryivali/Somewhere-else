Somewhere else, we aren't sure what's in store from truTV's Impractical Jokers: The Movie, which opened in 357 areas a weekend ago and conveyed a $2.7 million opening. This weekend the film will venture into 1,900 theaters and we're struggling finding any point of reference or examination for a film of this nature, which leaves us at a misfortune regarding what's in store. Until further notice we're focusing on a completion simply outside the main five and a $5 million three-day, however time will just tell.
